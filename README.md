CodeIgniter Google Timezone
======================
A CodeIgniter library to interact with Google Timezone API.

NOTE: I'm currently developing this for Sotrek and it currently provides only what I need. Feel free to email me (juanrodriguez@outlook.com) if you would like more functionality added. :-)
NOTE: It currenlty only supports American timezones.

### Configuration
This library requires a configuration file. See the config directory for an example.
